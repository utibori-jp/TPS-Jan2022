# Logs for "Tabular Playground Series - Jan 2022 from 2022/1/1

This is logs for my daily study of kaggle competition. I will record what I have learned and thought while working on kaggle.

## 2022/01/01
* I went over the competition overview and basic information about the data.
* I made this repository.

## 2022/01/02
* I searched the code for something that would be good to use as a baseline. I want to use something that uses LightBGM or XGBoost.
* I found a few things I liked.
## 2022/01/03
* I saw a code stacking LightBGM and XGBoost that I found yesterday.
* There was some work in the middle that I don't know why it was done. In addition to that, the importance of the features obtained from that work was high, so I'm not going to use it as a baseline.
* 
## 2022/01/04
* I saw another code using LightBGM from yesterday.
* I finished the implementation of the model, but I couldn't finish the evaluation of the model, so I will work on the rest tomorrow.

## 2022/01/05
* I worked on and finished the rest of yesterday.
* I understood most of the code itself, but I still have a limited understanding of XGBRegressor and Pipeline.

## 2022/01/08
* I spent the whole day learning how to use the pipeline.

## 2022/01/09
* After reading a few notebooks, I was not sure what I was supposed to do after that.
* I read the discussion to decide what to do next.
* I heard that ensembles give higher results than expected. Iwant to improve the accuracy of the model by the last week so that I can work on the ensemble in earnest.

## 2022/01/10
* For some reason my account was locked and I could't do it anymore. I don't know why, but it seems that others are experiencing the same thing, so we'll just have to wait and see.
